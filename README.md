**An intermediate-level data science project** that dives deep into customer behavior analytics using real e-commerce data. This comprehensive case study walks through the complete data analytics pipeline, from messy raw data to actionable business insights, making it perfect for data scientists looking to demonstrate practical industry skills.

Working with over 20,000 customer ratings and reviews, this project showcases advanced data cleaning techniques, statistical analysis, and business intelligence methodologies that you'd encounter in real-world e-commerce environments.

## Project Objectives

**Data Quality Mastery**
- Implement robust data cleaning and outlier detection methodologies
- Handle missing values and inconsistent data entries
- Apply advanced filtering techniques for statistical reliability

**Customer Behavior Analytics**
- Investigate rating patterns and potential demographic biases
- Analyze user engagement and activity patterns
- Perform correlation analysis between rating metrics

**Product Performance Intelligence**
- Evaluate category-specific customer satisfaction trends
- Identify top and bottom performing product segments
- Generate performance rankings with statistical significance

**Business Intelligence & Insights**
- Transform analytical findings into actionable business recommendations
- Create data-driven strategies for e-commerce optimization
- Develop frameworks for ongoing performance monitoring

## Key Research Findings

**Gender Bias Investigation**: Statistical analysis reveals no significant difference in rating patterns between male and female customers, enabling gender-neutral recommendation systems.

**Category Performance Analysis**: Discovered substantial performance gaps across product categories, with top performers achieving 4.8-star averages while underperformers struggle below 3.0 stars.

**Data Quality Assessment**: Achieved exceptional 99.6% data retention rate through systematic cleaning while identifying and addressing quality issues in 89.4% of records.

**Review Metrics Independence**: Confirmed that product ratings and review helpfulness operate as independent metrics, providing valuable insights for review system design.

## Technical Implementation

**Core Technologies**
- **Data Processing**: Pandas and NumPy for efficient data manipulation and numerical computing
- **Statistical Analysis**: Comprehensive correlation analysis, distribution testing, and outlier detection
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib and Seaborn for publication-quality data visualizations
- **Analytics Framework**: Custom business metrics and performance indicators

**Advanced Techniques**
- Multi-stage outlier detection algorithms
- Customer segmentation analysis
- Statistical significance testing
- Business performance indexing

## Dataset Characteristics

This project utilizes a rich e-commerce dataset containing:
- **Volume**: 20,000 customer interactions across 89 unique products
